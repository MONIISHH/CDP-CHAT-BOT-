Okay, here's a comprehensive documentation for the current state of the CDP chatbot project, including a breakdown of its components, how to use it, and some considerations for future development.

Project Title: CDP Chatbot

Project Description:

This project implements a chatbot that answers "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot leverages the official documentation of these CDPs to provide relevant answers to user queries. It includes a Python Flask backend for processing and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for the user interface.

I. Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

cdp_chatbot/
├── app.py         (Python Flask backend)
├── index.html     (HTML frontend)
├── style.css      (CSS stylesheet)
└── script.js      (JavaScript logic)

Use code with caution.

II. Technologies Used

Backend:

Python: Programming language for the backend logic.

Flask: Micro web framework for creating the API.

Requests: Library for making HTTP requests to scrape documentation.

Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4): Library for parsing HTML content.

Sentence Transformers: Library for generating text embeddings.

FAISS: Library for efficient similarity search of embeddings.

Numpy: Numerical library for python, to perform calculations of embedding vectors.

NLTK: Text processing library, to help with tokenization.

Frontend:

HTML: For structuring the user interface.

CSS: For styling the user interface.

JavaScript: For handling user interactions, making requests to the backend, and updating the UI dynamically.

III. Components

1. app.py (Python Flask Backend)

Functionality:

Web Scraping: Fetches documentation content from the official websites of Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap using requests and Beautiful Soup.

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the extracted text, including lowercasing, removing extra whitespace, and tokenizing.

Text Embedding: Generates embeddings (numerical representations) of the documentation text using Sentence Transformers.

FAISS Indexing: Indexes these embeddings using FAISS for quick similarity searches.

Chatbot Logic: Receives user questions, generates embeddings for the question, searches for the most similar documentation passages, and returns the results.

Flask API: Provides the following endpoints:

GET /: Serves the main page index.html.

POST /chat: Accepts user questions, processes them, and returns the chatbot's responses as JSON.

Error handling: Provides better error handling, by using try catch blocks and HTTP error codes.

Key Variables and Functions:

docs_urls: Dictionary of URLs for documentation of each CDP

scrape_docs(url): Scrapes and extracts text from a given URL.

preprocess_text(text): Cleans and preprocesses a given text.

chunk_text(text, chunk_size): Breaks text into smaller chunks.

answer_question(question): Generates the answer to the user's query.

Notes:

The python server automatically downloads the punkt resource required by nltk.

This server uses the SentenceTransformer model named all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

The python server will run locally, and will listen to http://localhost:5000.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow requests from your web page.

2. index.html (HTML Frontend)

Functionality:

Provides the basic structure for the chat interface, including a chat history area, an input field for typing questions, a "Send" button, and a loading indicator.

Key Elements:

<div class="chat-container">: Wraps all chat elements.

<div class="chat-history" id="chat-history">: Displays messages.

<div class="loading-indicator" id="loading">: Shows a message when the server is working.

<input type="text" id="user-input">: Allows users to enter their questions.

<button id="send-button">: Sends user questions to the backend.

3. style.css (CSS Stylesheet)

Functionality:

Provides the visual styling for the HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

Styles the chat window, messages, input field, button and loading indicator.

Key Styles:

Styles for the chat container, chat history, user messages, bot messages, sources, loading indicator.

4. script.js (JavaScript Logic)

Functionality:

Handles user interactions, such as typing a question and clicking the "Send" button.

Fetches data from the backend server using HTTP requests.

Appends the messages (user messages and chatbot responses) to the chat history area.

Shows and hides the loading indicator during requests.

Provides a basic error handling logic, showing the errors in the chat window.

Key Functions:

addMessageToChat(sender, message, sources = null): Adds a message to the chat history with the corresponding styles.

sendQuestionToBackend(question): Sends user question to the server, and handle the response. It shows a loading indicator during processing.

Event listener for the send button, that sends the user questions, and clears the input.

IV. How to Use

1. Prerequisites:

Python 3.6+: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

pip: Python package manager.

Virtual Environment (recommended)

All required python packages: Install all python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. A requirements.txt example is:

requests
beautifulsoup4
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
numpy
flask
flask-cors
nltk
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.

2. Setup:

Create a project directory: Create a new directory for your project, for example cdp-chatbot

Create python files:

Create an app.py file, copy the code from the python section above and paste into it.

Create the frontend files: Create an index.html, style.css and script.js and paste the code provided above.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal, navigate to the folder, and run pip install -r requirements.txt.

Start the python server: Run the app.py file using python app.py. The python server should start and listen to http://localhost:5000

3. Running:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Type your question in the chat input field.

Press the "Send" button to send the question to the server.

The chatbot's response (or error message) will appear in the chat history, with source links when possible.

V. Important Notes and Troubleshooting

Error Handling: If you are getting ModuleNotFoundError errors, make sure you have correctly installed all packages.

Backend Errors: If the backend server is not running, then the web page won't be able to send the questions. Verify that the app.py is running by checking the terminal output.

Python packages: If you are having any problem running the python server, please check the previous steps about resolving ModuleNotFoundError, make sure your pip is updated, and try installing all the python packages one by one.

Network Issues: If you are getting network errors, make sure your internet connection is working correctly.

Loading Indicator: If the loading indicator does not hide, there might be an issue in the server or in the Javascript code. Please check your browser console and the terminal to check for any errors.

CORS Errors: If you have any CORS errors, check that your browser is not blocking cross-origin requests.

Browser Console: Use your browser's developer tools (usually F12) to inspect network requests, console messages, and any other error messages.

VI. Future Development Considerations

Advanced Search: You can improve the accuracy of the search, by using more advanced searching techniques, by creating better text chunks, or by fine-tuning the embedding model.

Pagination: You can add a pagination mechanism to the responses in case they become too long.

Real-time Chat: You can use technologies like WebSockets to make the chat real-time and allow for streaming responses.

Improved UI/UX: Further improve the look and feel of the user interface to make it more user friendly.

Authentication: Add authentication mechanisms to restrict access to the chatbot if needed.

Scalability: As the number of documents grows, you can optimize the performance by using a proper database and optimizing the search process.

Contextual Awareness: Add context to the conversation by keeping a history of the user's requests to provide more precise answers.

More efficient scraping: You can use tools like Selenium to scrape websites that rely on Javascript.
